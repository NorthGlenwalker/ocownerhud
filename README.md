Let's work on the Owner Hud!
===========================

Early Goals:
------------

- Added a "help me with coding problems" file
- Clean up orphaned code in the scripts. ---- Some clean up done. (NG)
- Provide better commentary/documentation.
- Arrange things to make it more easily for a broader spectrum of people with various skill levels to contribute to this project!

- Find someone else then wendy101 with greater skill in programming to take on pull requests, keep code in-sync with their disk and the in-world device.
Found someone else yes, greater programming skill no!
