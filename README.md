Let's work on the Owner Hud!
===========================

New Goals: (3.840)
------------
- New collar link direct to RLV main menu - Update linking into Un/Dress menu instead, Hud section writen in - Done (NG)
- - Requested hook into Un/Dress Menu from Joy, along with change the main menu hook from "menuto" to "menu", this change will make the Owner hud incompatable with <3.839 collars (Joy has removed the old "menuto" code section as bad coding and rewritten
- Change llRegionSay -> llRegionSayTo - Done (NG)
- Remove all the AutoTP code since we no longer use this option in the Hud (Why did we have an option in the hud to turn AutoTP on and off?) - Done (NG)
- Adjusted the llOwnerSay string to be more descriptive by using Key2Name - EG when access a sub called sub123 main collar menu it will respond - "Sending to Sub123 Resident's collar - menu" - Done (NG)

3.800 Owners hud finished items:
---------------------------------
- Updated the RLV strip code in the cages to add the extra attach/wear points - Done (NG)
- New leash/unleash/follow Menu system - Done (NG)
- Re do TP menu system working within SL limits - Done (NG)
- Clean up orphaned code in the scripts. ---- Some clean up done. (NG)
- Provide better commentary/documentation. ---- Extra help files added to hud and comments in code (NG)

- Arrange things to make it more easily for a broader spectrum of people with various skill levels to contribute to this project!
- Find someone else then wendy101 with greater skill in programming to take on pull requests, keep code in-sync with their disk and the in-world device.
- - Found someone else yes, greater programming skill no! (NG)
