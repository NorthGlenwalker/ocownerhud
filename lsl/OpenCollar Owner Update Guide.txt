New changes since 3.800

-    New collar link direct to RLV main menu - Update linking into Un/Dress menu instead.
- - Requested hook into Un/Dress Menu, along with change the main menu hook from "menuto" to "menu", this change will make the Owner HUD incompatible with <3.840 collars 
-   Whole new "auth" system written into collar, HUD changed to reflect this
-    Change llRegionSay and llSay -> llRegionSayTo this speeds up all commands to the collar.
-    Remove all the AutoTP code since we no longer use this option in the Hud (Why did we have an option in the HUD to turn AutoTP on and off?)
-    Adjusted the llOwnerSay string to be more descriptive by using Key2Name - EG when access to a sub called sub123, the main collar menu will respond - "Sending to Sub123 Resident's collar - menu" 
-    Added "post" command to leash menu to bring up the collar "post menu" to display items to leash the collar to
-    ":" separator has been replaced with "\" so RLV commands from the HUD or cuffs are not chopped up before being actioned
-    removed colon from "command send" script and added to each button cmd string to enable easy TP to LM change in RLV accessed code
-    update cage rezzer script to use llRegionSayTo- now responds in under 1/2 second
-    Add leash post to cager menu
-    Adjusted Animation timeout from the HUD from 30 to 60 seconds
-    When you scan for subs now, the HUD will respond with all subs found in under 1 second, even in busy sims. Now displays the access level of that subs collar when found.
