How to set up the OpenCollar OwnersHud Owner Menu.
----------------------------------------------------
You need some basic edit skills, but I have tried to make it as easy as possible to set this up.

1) You can wear the Hud (but it should not be locked in position), in your inventory, find the Hud you are wearing, right click the Hud and select edit.
2) Select the Content Tab on the edit menu
3) Give it a few moments to fill it's list, then scroll down to 'OpenCollarHUD - Ownermenu' (should be the second last script just above rezzer.
4) Double click it or select open to open up the script, It should then look something like below.
5) All you do is change the parts in between the " " for both the 'Button' and corresponding 'cmd'
some basic ideas are included. You can change or add your own comments against buttons by adding // <Your own comments>.
6) Once finished select 'save' to save the script back to the HUD. It should see your new commands straight away,
7) if not you may have to select edit again and reset scripts. This will remove any subs stored in the HUD, but a minor task to rescan them again.

The menu system is designed to work with any command you would normally type in chat to access the collar you just leave off the sub/pet/etc's channel number and prefix IE instead to typing /1xrnadu, you just name a button as Nadu and add 'nadu' to the corresponding button. This command can then be sent to 1 or all your subs at once.

//-----------------------------------------------------------------

// You can add any command you normally type on the command line to access the collar.
// EG if you force your sub into nadu, you would norm,ally use /1<prefix>nadu
// see button 7 for this example.
// You need to reset the scripts after changes for the new settings to take effect

//This is where you change the text of each button, keep it short!
string Button1 = "Cuffs";
string Button2 = "RLVMenu";
string Button3 = "Ballgag";
string Button4 = "NoCuffs";
string Button5 = "NoBallgag";
string Button6 = " ";  //This will give a blank button for spacing (it should not be empty)
string Button7 = "Nadu";  //example of pose button
string Button8 = "Release";  //and release from pose button
string Button9 = "Button9";
string Button10 = "Button10";
string Button11 = "Button11";

//This is where you add the command you want the button to do
string cmd1 = "+cuffs"; //will attach the folder in #RLV called cuffs
string cmd2 = "rlv"; //will give you the collar rlv menu
string cmd3 = "+ballgag"; //will attach the folder named ballgag
string cmd4 = "-cuffs"; //will detach the #RLV folder called cuffs
string cmd5 = "-ballgag"; //will detach the #RLV folder called ballgag
string cmd6 = "cmd6";  //if the button is blank this can be anything
string cmd7 = "nadu";  //example of forcing a sub into nadu.
string cmd8 = "release"; //release from pose
string cmd9 = "cmd9";
string cmd10 = "cmd10";
string cmd11 = "cmd11";


//DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
