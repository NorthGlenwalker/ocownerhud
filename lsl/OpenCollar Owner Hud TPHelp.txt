Because of SL limitations you have to be within the same Sim to control a collar wearer.

To send someone to a different Sim, you need to have a landmark in your Owners hud first.
You can then force them to that location BEFORE you Teleport yourself.
You can add up to 10 Landmarks for locations to the HUD, just drop them into the HUD's contents through edit. (limited to 512 total characters including spaces total)
This is useful to send multiple subs to the same landmark at once.

Or you can send a TP invite (lure) through IM's once you get there.
