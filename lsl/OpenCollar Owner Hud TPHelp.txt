Because of SL limitations you have to be within the same region to control a wearer.

To send someone to a different Sim, you need to have a landmark in your Owners hud first.
You can then force them to that location BEFORE you Teleport yourself.
You can add up to 10 Landmarks for locations to the HUD, just drop them into the HUD's contents through edit.
This is usefull to send multiple subs to the same landmark at once.


Or you can send a TP invite through IM's once you get there.
