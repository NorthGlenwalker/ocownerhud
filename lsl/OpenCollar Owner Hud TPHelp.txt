Because of SL limitations you have to be within the same Region to control a collar wearer.

To send someone to a different Sim, you need to have a landmark in your Owners Hud first.
You can then force them to that location BEFORE you Teleport yourself.
You can add up to 10 Landmarks for locations to the HUD, just drop them into the HUD's contents through edit. (limited to 512 total characters including spaces total)
The hud does not like multiple locations all starting the same as it only uses the first 8 letters for uniqueness. So please don't have -
My Deep Dungeon Rack
My Deep Dungeon Stocks
My Deep Dungeon Cross
have
My Rack
My Stocks
My Cross

This is useful to send multiple subs to the same landmark at once.

Or you can send a TP invite (lure) through IM's once you get there.
