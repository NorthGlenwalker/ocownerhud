Guide for the OpenCollar Owner HUD  Vers. 2.0

􀀀

_______________________________________

The HUD is designed to be attached to any point of your HUD. Attaching it to the two center positions might get in the way, but if you were really limited on HUD attach points, you could manually edit/move its position off to the sides. 

ALL HUDs may be slightly hidden when attached on the bottom three attach points.  This is due to the limitation that HUDs are positioned by the corner of the users screen rather then the raised menu bar.   
>> To fix simply right click and edit the position slightly.  The Owners HUD is smart enough to not reset your manual adjustments unless you reattach it to a new attach point.

Subs do not get added to the Owner HUD automatically.
This means, when you become the new owner of a sub, you have to update the HUD by hitting the [Scan Subs] button in the [Subs] menu.
*note: If a sub does not show up, you may have to be re added to the sub's collar.
Other Subs who have their collars set to open will also get registered, so is advised to scan in a low sub area
You can also be removed as a subs Owner by clicking [Remove Sub]

Chat commands (default channel is 7):
/7menu  -> opens the hud's menu
/7couples -> opens the hud's couple animation menu
/7hug name -> will ask name to accept a hug 
(available couple anims are: hug, kiss, hugsub, kissfoot, lickboot, jumphug... where the animations are opposite the one ones in the collar!)
/7channel x -> changes the hud listen channel to x (where x has to be > 0 )

To be able to use the HUD's TP features you have to ensure two things:

*** Please be aware that for the submissive,RLV, the Restrained Life (Love) Viewer, will make  restraints un-detachable and other restrictive Measures can be enforced. These are measures that can test your relationship between an Owner and a submissive.

Please remember that using RLV is something that You will need to have an open communication with your submissive about due to the amount of power exchanged between you and your submissive.  Is not to be be taken lightly as some are not comfortable with it and will need to grow into wanting to use RLV to enhance their Second life.  

We recommend the Owner and the collar wearer / submissive take a few of the Intro to BDSM in SL classes offered around the grid and how to use RLV classes in SL if they are not familiar with the features of RLV to prevent misunderstanding and sour their hard found relationship.

Have Fun!
